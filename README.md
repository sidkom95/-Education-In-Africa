## Abstract
The *African Development Bank Group* statistical data portal offers an immense range of socio-economic indicators for each African country from 1960 until now. This three-dimensional data precision (country, year, over 200 indicators) provides sufficient tools for our project to perform a spatio-temporal analysis of the educational factors in African countries and the impact on their social and economical growth. 

The African continent is made of young developing countries and is full of unexploited resources and unexplored richness. This thus provides a ground for development and growth. In an absence of financial resources and historical power, education is the best tool for a socio-economical revolution, especially when we consider that this continent has a demographically young population. 

As a further endeavor, using machine learning tools, we came up with a new socio-economic index quantifying the effectiveness and importance of a country's efforts in developing education.


## Research questions
* What are the general trends of education importance in African countries in relation to georgraphy and time?
* What relations can be extracted between education and other socio-economic indicators?
* What conclusions can be drawn from the importance of education in economic growth?
* What factors are most influenced by the educational approach of each country?
* Can we come up with a new index measuring the effectiveness of the educational endeavours of each country?

## Datasets
The datasets we will use are retreived from the *African Development Bank Group* statistical data portal. A series of 200+ socio-economic indicators are provided for each country, per year. Each entry of the datasets is for a specific indicator, for a specific country and for a specific year. A grouping will be performed based on the countries, years and indicators such that the cleaned dataframe would be using a two-dimensional indexing: **country** & **year**. The columns will then correspond to the different indicator values.
